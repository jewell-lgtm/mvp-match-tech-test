[ ] Implement /buy endpoint (accepts productId, amount of products) so users with a “buyer” role can buy products with the money they’ve deposited. API should return total they’ve spent, products they’ve purchased and their change if there’s any (in 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 cent coins)
[ ] Implement /reset endpoint so users with a “buyer” role can reset their deposit
